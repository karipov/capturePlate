```This document is provided to summarise Swiss Law regarding data protection, but specifically the tracking of car license plates, their storage and usage. It is made solely for the purpose of convenience, and has no legal effect.

The type of system used in this case directly lists personal characteristics, which is the vehicle license plate number, by method of computer recognition as the vehicle passes through certain checkpoints. No personal information, other than the license plate number is recorded. Nonetheless, it still entails the processing of data within the scope of the Federal Data Protection Act.

There must always be a *justification* for a tracking system to be used, which can be expressed in either the *consent* of the persons concerned or an *overriding private interest*. It is difficult to obtain a legally valid consent of the persons involved in this case of parking and traffic flow on private property; however, there is a *private overriding interest* in place that gives legal justification for the system to be put in place.

This *private overriding interest* can be stated in the fact that the system in place will be used solely for the purposes of measuring traffic flow, including statistics on the duration of parking. There are no categories that specify individuals, and the data isn't combined with other data to increase possibilities of identification. Furthermore, data relating to individuals is erased as soon as they leave the perimeter.

However, regardless of what *justification* is given, the persons concerned must be duly informed of the manner in which the data collected by the system will be processed. The main requirements are:
- The persons concerned must be informed of the existence of the system before entering the perimeter.
- It is necessary to develop standard documentation which provides information on the main aspects of the processing of license plate data.
